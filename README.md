# Blast-Sequence-Alignment
This project provides a Python script to process sequencing data, analyze genetic variations, and make predictions. 
It integrates various tools such as BLAST for sequence alignment, VCFtools for variant analysis, MySQL for database storage, 
scikit-learn for machine learning predictions, and matplotlib for data visualization. Additionally, the results are presented in a PowerPoint presentation for easy sharing.

Features
- MySQL Integration: Store genetic sequence data in a MySQL database.
- BLAST Sequence Alignment: Perform sequence alignment with BLAST.
- VCF Variant Analysis: Parse and analyze genetic variants from VCF files.
- Machine Learning Predictions: Use a Random Forest model to predict genetic variation outcomes (e.g., plant resistance).
- Data Visualization: Plot genetic variation frequencies using matplotlib.
- PowerPoint Generation: Create a PowerPoint presentation to share results.

Python Libraries:
mysql-connector-python – For connecting to MySQL.
vcf – For parsing and analyzing VCF files.
numpy – For numerical data handling.
matplotlib – For creating visualizations.
python-pptx – For generating PowerPoint presentations.
scikit-learn – For machine learning.

Necessary Dependencies:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install mysql-connector-python vcf numpy matplotlib python-pptx scikit-learn

Additional Tools:
BLAST: The script runs BLAST for sequence alignment. Install it from NCBI BLAST.
VCFtools: Used for analyzing genetic variants. Install it via VCFtools GitHub.
